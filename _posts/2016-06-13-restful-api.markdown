When we use API to work, the authentication is the first or the most important thing we need to finish.

As the API need authorization, OAuth2.0 is involved.

[OAuth2.0 Chinese reference](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/05/oauth_2_0.html)

[Linked Restful API](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/rest-api) give me a very good example to study

Restful API
