dependency injection vs hook
============================
Drupal 8 provide two way to alter original drupal core behaviours. 

One is using hook as Drupal 7, please check here for more detail.

Another way is the OO way using dependency injection, here's the official [documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/services-and-dependency-injection/services-and-dependency-injection-in-drupal-8) about the `Dependency Injection`. 

And here's a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/drupal-8-hooks-symfony-event-dispatcher/) on sitepoint to compare two of them. 

For sure, Drupal 8 encourage to use the later one to make all the logic decouple and testable.
