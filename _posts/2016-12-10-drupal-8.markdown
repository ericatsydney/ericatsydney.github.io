EventDispatcher vs Hook
=======================
Drupal 8 provide two way to alter original drupal core behaviours. 

One way is using hook as Drupal 7, please check [this blog](http://ericatsydney.github.io/geek/2016/05/24/drupal-hook.html) for more detail.

Another way is using `EventDispatcher`. Here's a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/drupal-8-hooks-symfony-event-dispatcher/) on sitepoint to compare two of them. 

For sure, Drupal 8 encourage useing the `EventDispatcher` to make all the logic decouple and testable. And Invoke hook may be totally removed on Drupal 9.

====================
Using dependency injection, here's the official [documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/services-and-dependency-injection/services-and-dependency-injection-in-drupal-8) about the `Dependency Injection`.
 
And this is the [mechanism](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) behind the scene.
