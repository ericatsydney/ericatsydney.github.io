Lombok is a very controversial java project, some of us hate it, others love it.

I read some articles like this [Don't Use Lombok](https://artofcode.wordpress.com/2018/12/18/dont-use-lombok/).

After reading, I would like to say:

- Have you tried to get used to the Lombok for a few weeks?

- Is it still relevant in 2021 to complaint about the Lombok compatibility with Java 11?

I doubt about that. I use Lombok as the daily utility in different Java project, I found once you get used to that, it improve the efficiency on both reading and writing.

And it is not error prone at all if you understand it well enough. 

When I learn how to use Lombok, I found [this article](https://medium.com/@ppbruna/why-you-should-not-use-lombok-f7556662e8c3) is useful, because it gave the insight on individual method, and when to use and when not use.
