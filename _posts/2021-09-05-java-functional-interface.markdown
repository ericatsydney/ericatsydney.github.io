Use Case 1
============
In the interface, we can define default method and return a function with input and output type using generic.
 
In the concret class, we can define the type. Then at run time pass in the input.

That's a good idea for function programing.



Use Case 2
================
All the subclass extend from a same parent class and use @component, make sure will be scaned into the context.

Use @Autowired (by type) to initiate the List<ParentClass>, at runtime we can get the list of all sub class.
