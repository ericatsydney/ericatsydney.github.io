从小就觉得表达自己是一件不容易的事，是不是思维问题，又或者是天生的。如果可以冷静下来，应该有7成把握可以做好表达，另外三成是靠练习和技巧。

来到英语世界，表达好自己就更加不容易了。下面是我的一些总结：

从打招呼开始：

What's up? -> nothing
 How have you been? -> same old
 How are you? -> pretty well / good
 hey man / yo -> what's up
 Howdy

评价：

Sweet/ Sick / Awesome  很好的意思

Suck 很糟糕

GG / Good game 做得不错，有时是讽刺

日常对话：

What did you get for your lunch?

Propably / Apparently / it seems

Fair enough

I cannot make it

I will buzz you

工作上的问题陈述方式：

名词：Exclamation, flexibility, demo/ prototype

形容词：ideal / future-proofing

副词：eventually, temporarily, actually, basically

动词：go, remove, point to, Assign, Nest / embed, Render, Store, Override, make, require, set, use, switch over, assume, take over, combine

短语：

What if / How about/ What do you think

I have a feeling that / I feel like we missed / I am not 100% clear on / sure about / Pretty sure

best approach might be

Almost/nearly/pretty much done/ completed / sure thing

I didn't have a chance to ....

it would get cached

have anyone experienced this / That ring my bell.

Split up / Separate pages

waste time doing sth / this is for the benefit of xxxx / which can be avoided  / base on xxxx / depend on

in read-only mode / at the moment

doesn't appear / what exactly the issue was

looking to do sth / looking into this now / have you attempt to

clarify xxx stuff/ apply the change

which is unfortunateyou have a minute, I would like to confirm the design with you
