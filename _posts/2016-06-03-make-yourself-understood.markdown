简单清楚地表达想法，对我来说从来不是一件容易的事。在我看来，我在语言组织（流畅）、逻辑（清晰）、信心（稳定），上都有待改进：

##从词汇开始##

名词：Exclamation, flexibility, demo/ prototype, parentheses, caret

形容词：ideal / future-proofing， Sweet/ Sick / Awesome  很好的意思， Suck 很糟糕

副词：eventually, temporarily, actually, basically

动词：go, remove, point to, Assign, Nest / embed, Render, Store, Override, make, require, set, use, switch over, assume, take over, combine, miss out, enable

##日常对话的短语##

 What's up / what's happening? -> nothing

 How have you been? -> same old

 How are you? -> pretty well / good

 hey man / yo -> what's up

 Howdy / Howdy

 Propably / Apparently / it seems

 Fair enough

 I cannot make it

 I will buzz you

 GG / Good game 做得不错，有时是讽刺
 
 kind of 

##工作上的问题陈述方式（逻辑）：##

陈述（总分关系， 顺序关系， 转折关系， 递进关系）：then / but / further more

对比（选择关系）：the down side of xxxx is that / alternatively

解释 (因果关系)：this is for the benefit of xxxx / base on xxxx / depend on / it would get cached / in a different aspect / That ring my bell / cause / so / due to

假设（条件关系）： Using this method, xxxxxxx / By requesting A, xxxxxx / If xxxxxx / Once xxxxxx / When xxxxxx /

提议：best approach might be / What if / How about/ What do you think / have you attempt to / if you have a minute, I would like to confirm the design with you

提问：have anyone experience this / how to reproduce this problem

判断：I have a feeling that / I feel like we missed / I am not 100% clear on / sure about / Pretty sure / I reckon

肯定： Almost/nearly/pretty much done/ completed / sure thing

否定： I didn't have a chance to .... / which can be avoided  / doesn't appear / what exactly the issue was / which is unfortunate
