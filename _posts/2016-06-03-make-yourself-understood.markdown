简单清楚地表达想法，对我来说从来不是一件容易的事。在我看来，我在语言组织（流畅）、逻辑（清晰）、信心（稳定），上都有待改进：

##一切从词汇开始##

名词：Exclamation, flexibility, demo/ prototype

形容词：ideal / future-proofing， Sweet/ Sick / Awesome  很好的意思， Suck 很糟糕

副词：eventually, temporarily, actually, basically

动词：go, remove, point to, Assign, Nest / embed, Render, Store, Override, make, require, set, use, switch over, assume, take over, combine, miss out, enable

##如何打招呼:##

 What's up? -> nothing

 How have you been? -> same old

 How are you? -> pretty well / good

 hey man / yo -> what's up

 Howdy

##日常对话的短语##

What did you get for your lunch?

Propably / Apparently / it seems

Fair enough

I cannot make it

I will buzz you

GG / Good game 做得不错，有时是讽刺

##工作上的问题陈述方式：##

询问意见：What if / How about/ What do you think

step back in a different aspect to see

I have a feeling that / I feel like we missed / I am not 100% clear on / sure about / Pretty sure

best approach might be

Almost/nearly/pretty much done/ completed / sure thing

I didn't have a chance to ....

it would get cached

have anyone experienced this / That ring my bell.

Split up / Separate pages

waste time doing sth / this is for the benefit of xxxx / which can be avoided  / base on xxxx / depend on

in read-only mode / at the moment

doesn't appear / what exactly the issue was

looking to do sth / looking into this now / have you attempt to

clarify xxx stuff/ apply the change

which is unfortunateyou have a minute, I would like to confirm the design with you

##逻辑##

总分关系：

因果关系： because, so, that's why

递进关系：further more

转折关系： but

顺序关系：then

选择关系：alternatively

补充说明：which means xxxx

条件：If xxxxxx / Once xxxxxx / When xxxxxx / Using this method, xxxxxxx

对比：the down side of xxxx is that

##技巧##

直指要点，再分步说明。
