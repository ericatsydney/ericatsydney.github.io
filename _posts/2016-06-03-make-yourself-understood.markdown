从小就觉得表达自己是一件不容易的事，是不是思维问题，又或者是天生的。如果可以冷静下来，应该有7成把握可以做好表达，另外三成是靠练习和技巧。

来到英语世界，表达好自己就更加不容易了。下面是我的一些总结：

从打招呼开始：

What's up?/ How have you been? / Howdy / How are you?

回答：

Same Old/ Pretty Well/ Good， yourself.

评价：

sweet/ Sick / Awesome  很好的意思

Suck 很糟糕

GG / Good game 做得不错，有时是讽刺

日常对话：

What did you get for your lunch?

Propably / Apparently / it seems

Fair enough

go

base on xxxx

it would get cached

Pretty sure

I cannot make it

I will buzz you

工作上的问题陈述方式：

have anyone experienced this

That ring my bell.

which can be avoided

temporarily

waste time doing sth

this is for the benefit of xxxx

point to

in read-only mode

What if / How about

What do you think

Split up / Separate pages

I have a feeling that / I feel like we missed

at the moment

what exactly the issue was

doesn't appear

looking into this now

have you attempt to

future-proofing

flexibility

Assign

Nest / embed

Render

Store

Override

make

require

set

use

ideal

assume

depend on

happy

combine

apply the change

best approach might be

remove

I am not 100% clear on / sure about

Almost/nearly/pretty much done/ completed

demo/ prototype

sure thing

clarify xxx stuff

actually, basically

looking to do sth

switch over

take over

which is unfortunate

I didn't have a chance to ....

Do you have a minute, I would like to confirm the design with you

感叹号
