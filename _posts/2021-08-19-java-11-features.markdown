- use `var` in Lambda, `var` is introduced in Java 10 as the local variable, by using var, we don't need to specify the actual type. And in Java 11, this change make it consistent in lambda as well.
- new string method to check if blank etc.
- collection to array
- not predicate method
- use `java` to run source file 

side note: `val` is the lombok feature, but not Java 11 feature.
