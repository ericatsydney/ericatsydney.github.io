OO Design Principle
=======================

SOLID 

- Single responsibility 
    - move common method out

- Open-closed principle: open for extend, closed for modification

- Liskov substitution: object can be replace by subtype, still correct

- Interface segregation: small specific interface better than single generic one.

- Dependency inversion: depend on abstraction but not concretions.
    - avoid using new keyword in method,make the test easier
