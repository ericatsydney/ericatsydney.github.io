Gulp
====
Gulp is the build script to automate the preprocess. We can use gulp to convert sass, jsx, ES6, and minify, generate source map and so on. 

`broserify` is the tran

`gulp-babel` 

`babelify` 

`gulp-bundle` will output bab

`vinly-source-stream` and `gulp.src()`???

`watchify`


npm - Node Package Management
=============================

npm/Gulp is one of the most important skill set of front-end developer. It help us build our app making use of the open source library and on the other hand it setup a very good standard for the developer going to put their project as open source.

`npm install --save` 
symlink error: use option `--no-bin-links`
specify version: could add version like this `package_name@version` or update the package 

`npm update`

`npm list`

`npm rebuild` 'binding not found' may be caused by node version upgrade, we can use this command to fix

`npm uninstall`

`package.json` is the npm config file. In this file, we can use prefix to control which version of the package to install. e.g. '1.2.3' using '~' (same 1st and 2nd partition) or '^' (latest and same 1st partition) as prefix.
