Java
============
Pro: strong at data structure, type safe
Con: no CLI for dependency management


Nodejs
=============
Pro: fast, hot loading is amazing
Con: not type safe

TypeScript
==============
Pro: compared with normal Javascript, the Typescript will check type of parameter.
Con: 

Unlike Java, TypeScript doesn't have `int` and `float` in runtime env, both are combined as `number`.

In TypeScript if you try to access a property doesn't exist, it will return `undefined` rather than throw runtime error.

Python
============
[Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) is the black magic in Python, and it's good way to understand Python method as first class citizen in that lanaguage.
