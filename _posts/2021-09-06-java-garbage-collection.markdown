In order to know Java Garbage collection, we need to understand [how the JVM to memory and thread works](https://stackify.com/jvm-metrics/).

The Java profiler is a set metrics (cpu, memory and thread) in a certain period. The different performance monitoring products will provide the [different format profilers](https://stackify.com/java-profilers-3-types/).

[VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/) is one of them, it is a open source tool to provide the standard JVM profiling, it's very useful to do garbage collection.
