Data structures can help us store real world data (e.g. product categories), the method provided by abstracted class keep traverse and CRUD very handy.

In my day-to-day programing, I found `ArrayList`, `HashMap` and `HashSet` is most useful.   

**ArrayList**

ArrayList is the array can grow and shrink dynamically. To create an arrayList, we can use this code

{% highlight java%}
// List.of (Java 9) will return non-sizeable, to make it modifiable, we need to pass the result into ArrayList constructor.
var categories1 = new ArrayList<>(List.of("table","chair","sofa","bed"))

// And here's another way to create array list:
List<String> categories2 = new ArrayList<String>();
categories2.add("table");
categories2.add("chair");
categories2.add("sofa");
categories2.add("bed");
{% endhighlight%}

To iterate the array list, we can use the lambda expression (Java 8) to do that
{% highlight java%}
categories1.forEach(c -> system.out.println(c));
{% endhighlight%}

All the classes implement List interface are ordered collection. So the elements in ArrayList is also ordered, while the HashMap is not. 

**HashedMap**
HashMap is the key/value associations. As mentioned above, there's no sequence guarantee for map. 

{% highlight java%}
var product = new HashMap<String, String>;
product.put("1234-567", "dinning table VANGSTA");
product.put("1234-568", "dinning table MELLTORP");
product.put("1234-569", "dinning table KULLABERG");
product.put("1234-570", "dinning table NORRÃ…KER");
{% endhighlight%}

**Set**
Set is the collection not allowing the duplication, it will make sure the item is unique in the set.

{% highlight java%}

private static final Set<String> STATES = Sets.newHashSet("ACT", "NSW", "NT", "QLD", "SA", "TAS", "VIC", "WA");
{% endhighlight%}
