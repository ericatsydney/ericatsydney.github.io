- Use `var` in Lambda, `var` is introduced in Java 10 as the local variable, by using var, we don't need to specify the actual type. And in Java 11, this change make it consistent in lambda as well.
- New string method to check if blank etc.
- Collection to array
- `Predicate.not()` method to negate predicate.
- Use command `java` to run java source file without compilation. 

side note: `val` is the lombok feature, but not Java 11 feature.
