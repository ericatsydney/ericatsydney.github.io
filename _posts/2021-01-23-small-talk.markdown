The other day I found [an excellent youtube video about small talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGoIoDuf83o&t=504s). It mentioned the Top Five topics of Small Talk are:

Work, Life, Travel, Food, Weather

Knowing the topics are not enough. As the practice, it is suggested to list some questions and try to answer them in your way. 

Then you can reuse them in your real live. I list mine here:

*Work*

A: I am a software engineer.

Q: What motivate you to be a sofware engineer/ What do you love about your job?

A: I found this job is very challenging, we can turn the design into reality/vituality, and build the things up from scratch.

Q: What's your typical workday look like?

A: Every morning, the team will have a catch-up to give a round table update, which we call stand-up meeting, in the meeting everyone can know about each other's progress and who need helps on anything. Then we will start the programming and testing. In between the acutal work, we will also have some meetings with other teams to make sure the project smooth.
